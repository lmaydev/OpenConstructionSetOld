# The Open Construction Set

The OCS is a modding SDK for [Kenshi](https://lofigames.com/) written in C#

It provides services for dealing with the various folders and data files used by the game.
As well as providing a managed context for loading multiple mods for editing (Similar to FCS)

## Introduction
### Project Setup
Add the main nuget (https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenConstructionSet/)

Optionally add the dependency injection nuget (https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenConstructionSet.DependencyInjection/)

### Using Dependency Injection
Once you have a reference to the dependency injection assembly simple add OCS to your services.

```csharp
services.UseOpenContructionSet();
```

This will setup the ```IInstallationService``` and the `IContextBuilder`

### Using Services directly

Both services can be contructed normally

```csharp
var installationService = new InstallationService();
var contextBuilder = new ContextBuilder();
```

### Services
- ```IInstallationService``` - Provides functions for locating installations of the game.
- ```IContextBuilder``` - Provides functions for building FCS like Mod Contexts. These allow multiple base and/or active mods to be loaded for editing.
